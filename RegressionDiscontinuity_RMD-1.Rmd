## First Steps 

NOTE: Your data needs to be in the folder where your code is located!

The first Chunk of Code will always do 3 Things for us

1) Clear ALL Variables (to make sure nothing is "left over") and clear the screen. 
2) Read in the data we want to use. In our case the file is called "Data_RD_R.csv"
3) Explore the data (what variables are in it and what are some basic statistics for these variables)

```{r}

# Clear All Variables & Clear Screen
rm(list=ls())
cat("\014")

# Read in the Data
data.RD = read.csv("Data_RD_R.csv")

# Explore the data
str(data.RD)
summary(data.RD)

```


## Effect of Reward

Step 1: Base Model - Linear Regression

```{r}

# Run basic regression.
# We pretrend there that the assignment of the reward (free room) IS RANDOM
# Recall that the reward is offered if play is above $500
# So we pretend that this is a true experiment (which it is not)
lm.model <- lm(y_revenue ~ x_target, data= data.RD)
summary(lm.model)

```


Step 2: Better Model, Regression Discontinuity

```{r}

#install.packages("rdd")
library(rdd)

# Caculate Bandwidth for Sample of "Apples to Apples" Comparison
# Cutpoint is value at which reward (or more general, treatment) is given in our example ($500)
# Key idea is that people just below and just above the cutoff of $500 are the most similar
# So in effect, we are trying to build an experiment in the data (also called quasi-experiment)
bw = IKbandwidth(data.RD$x_reward, data.RD$y_revenue, cutpoint = 500, kernel = "triangular")

# Select only Data within the bandwidth
# Loop over all data and only select data within bandwidth of cutpoint. In this example the intervall is 500-24 to 500+24
nobs = dim(data.RD)[1]
data.RD.bw = setNames(data.frame(matrix(ncol = 3, nrow = nobs)), c("y_revenue","x_reward","x_target"))

ct=1
for (i in 1:nobs) {
  if (data.RD$x_reward[i]<500-bw | data.RD$x_reward[i]>500+bw) {}
  else {
    data.RD.bw$y_revenue[ct] = data.RD$y_revenue[i]
    data.RD.bw$x_reward[ct]  = data.RD$x_reward[i]
    data.RD.bw$x_target[ct]  = data.RD$x_target[i]
    ct = ct+1
  }
}            

# RD Model on only 
# Note model automatically deleted all data that is zero. As we are building the matrix above it has ct observations and nobs-ct data fields that are all zero
lm.rd.model <- lm(y_revenue ~ x_target, data= data.RD.bw)
summary(lm.rd.model)

```


Step 3: Compare Insights

```{r}

# Profit Implications, recall cost of room is $200
ROI.reg = (lm.model$coefficients[2]-200)/200*100
ROI.rd  = (lm.rd.model$coefficients[2]-200)/200*100

# Difference in Insights
fit <- matrix(c(lm.model$coefficients,ROI.reg,lm.rd.model$coefficients,ROI.rd),ncol=2,nrow=3)
colnames(fit) <- c("Regression","Regression Discontinuity")
rownames(fit) <- c("Intercept","Effect of Reward","ROI (%)")

# install.packages("formattable")
library(formattable)
formattable(fit)

```
